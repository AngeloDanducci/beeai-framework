The Logger is a key component designed to record and track events, errors, and other important actions during an application's execution. It provides valuable insights into the application's behavior, performance, and potential issues, helping developers and system administrators troubleshoot and monitor the system effectively.

In the BeeAI Framework, the [Logger TODO]() class is an abstraction built on top of the built in python logger.
